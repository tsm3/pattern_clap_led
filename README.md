# pattern_clap_led
Improving on classic clap lights/LEDs by encoding more controls into patterns of clapping

I wasn't satisfied with the commercial home automation LED systems available (controlled via remote, app, Home Speaker), 
and wanted to develop a more robust, customizable, LED controller.  Deciding that I wanted to control LEDs from far away,
without needing a remote of any sort, I settled on extending traditional "clap light" functionality.
